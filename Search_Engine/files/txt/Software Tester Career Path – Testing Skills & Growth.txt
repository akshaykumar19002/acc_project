simple try it out and if software testing does not excite you switch to something else that holds your interest. non-technical skills of a software tester technical skills this list is long, so please bear with us basic knowledge of database/ sql: software systems have a large amount of data in the background. this data is stored in different types of databases like oracle, mysql, etc. in the backend. so, there will be situations when this data needs to be validated. in that case, simple/complex sql queries can be used to check whether proper data is stored in the backend databases. basic knowledge of linux commands: most of the software applications like web-services, databases, application servers are deployed on linux machines.so it is crucial for testers to have knowledge about linux commands. knowledge and hands-on experience of a test management tool:test management is an important aspect of software testing. without proper test management techniques, software testing process will fail. test management is nothing but managing your testing related artifacts. for example – a tool like testlink can be used for tracking all the test cases written by your team. there are other tools available that can be utilized for test management. so, it is important to have knowledge and working experience of such tools because they are used in most of the companies. knowledge and hands-on experience of any defect tracking tool- defect tracking and defect life cycle are key aspects of software testing. it is extremely critical to managing defects properly and track them in a systematic manner. defect tracking becomes necessary because the entire team should know about the defect including managers, developers, and testers. several tools are used to log defects including qc, bugzilla, jira, etc. knowledge and hands-on experience of automation tool: if you see yourself as an “automation tester” after a couple of years working on manual testing, then you must master a tool and get in-depth, hands-on knowledge of automation tools. note – only knowledge of any automation tool is not sufficient to crack the interview, you must have good hands-on experience, so practice the tool of your choice to achieve mastery. knowledge of any scripting language like vbscript, javascript, c# is always helpful as a tester if you are looking for a job into automation. few companies also use shell/perl scripting, and there is a lot of demand for testers having knowledge of the same. again, it will depend on the company and which tools are used by that company. there is also a lot of scope for performance testing tools because applications need to be tested for their performance which is a part of non-functional testing. that’s it to technical knowledge. please note you do not need all the technical skills listed above. the technical skill sets required vary with the job role and company processes. academic background academic background of a software tester should be in computer science. a btech/ b.e., mca, bca (bachelor of computer applications), bsc- computers, will land you a job quickly. if you do not hold any of these degrees, then you must complete a software testing certification like istqb and cste which help you learn software development/ test life cycle and other testing methodologies. remuneration compensation of a software tester varies from company to company. average salary range of a software tester in the us is $45,993 – $74,935. average software testing career package in india is rs 247,315 – rs 449,111. also, a software tester is also given health insurance, bonuses, gratuity and other perks. what does a software tester do?
