here are the reasons for learning operating systems: allows you to hide details of hardware by creating an abstraction easy to use with a gui offers an environment in which a user may execute programs and applications operating system acts as an intermediary among applications and the hardware components it provides the computer system resources in easy to use formats what are the applications of the operating system? following are some of the important activities that an operating system performs: security: operating system prevents unauthorized access to programs and data. controls the performance of a system: recording delays between a request for a service and response from the system. job accounting: you can keep track of the time and resources. error detecting aids: os helps to trace error messages and other debugging and error detecting aids. helps to coordinate between other software: coordination and assignment of compilers, interpreters, assemblers, and other software. features of operating system: here is a list of commonly found important features of an operating system: protected and supervisor mode allows disk access and file systems device drivers networking security program execution memory management handling i/o operations manipulation of the file system error detection and handling resource allocation information and resource protection what will you learn in this os tutorial? in this operating system tutorial, you will learn the operating systemâ€™s concept, types of operating systems, real-time operating systems, paging, scheduling methods (sjf, round robin), system calls in the operating system, bankerâ€™s algorithm, livelock, and deadlock mechanism. are there any prerequisites for this os tutorial? this os tutorial has been prepared for absolute beginners. it helps them to understand the basic to advanced and intermediate concepts related to operating system. however, before learning this os tutorial, it is preferable that you know the fundamental computer concepts like what is keyboard, mouse, monitor, input-output, primary memory(ram), secondary memory(rom), etc. who should learn operating system? this os tutorial is designed to help beginners as well as professionals. after learning the operating system, you can explore job and career opportunities as an operating systems analyst, operating systems programmer. this os tutorial is also designed to help gate aspirants for exam preparation and useful for examinations like nta ugc net computer science and applications. post navigation report a bug next continue top tutorials about about us advertise with us write for us contact us python testing hacking career suggestion sap career suggestion tool software testing as a career interesting ebook blog quiz sap ebook sap java sql execute online execute java online execute javascript execute html execute python selenium cryptocurrency vpns Â© copyright - guru99 2022 privacy policy | affiliate disclaimer | tos scroll to top home testingexpand child menu expand agile testing junit quality center(alm) bugzilla hp loadrunner rpa cucumber software testing sap testing database testing mobile testing selenium etl testing mantis soapui jmeter postman test management jira qtp testlink sapexpand child menu expand abap crm pi/po apo crystal reports pp beginners fico sd basis hana sapui5 bods hr security tutorial bi/bw mm solution manager bpc qm successfactors co payroll sap courses webexpand child menu expand apache java php sql server angularjs jsp pl/sql uml asp.net kotlin postgresql vb.net c linux python vbscript c# mariadb reactjs web services c++ ms access ruby & rails wpf codeigniter mysql scala sqlite dbms node.js sql perl javascript must learnexpand child menu expand accounting embedded systems operating system algorithms ethical hacking pmp android excel tutorial photoshop blockchain go programming project management business analyst iot reviews build website itil salesforce cloud computing jenkins seo cobol mis software engineering compiler design movie vba courses networking vpn big dataexpand child menu expand aws hive power bi big data informatica qlikview cassandra microstrategy tableau cognos mongodb talend data warehousing nifi zookeeper devops obiee pentaho hbase live projectexpand child menu expand live agile testing live selenium project live hp alm live selenium 2 live java project live security testing live mobile testing live testing project live payment gateway live testing 2 live php project live telecom live projects hub live uft/qtp testing live python project live seo project aiexpand child menu expand artificial intelligence pytorch data science r programming keras tensorflow nltk toggle menu close search for: search
